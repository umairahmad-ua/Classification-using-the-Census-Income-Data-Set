# Introduction

- The main aim of this project is to implement and compare different learning model

- In this Assignment, we are provided with structured dataset of Census Income Data Set provided by UCI

- The task is to trained model on the given dataset using Machine Learning algorithm

- The problem of 'Income Prediction' is treated as a classification and supervised learning problem
